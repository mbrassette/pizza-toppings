# Mercury New Media - Coding Screen

You are working with a large Fortune 500 client on their Advanced Proprietary Pizza Logistics Engine (APPLE).

The client has collected a dataset `Data.json` on it's 2000 employees and wants to figure out a few VERY IMPORTANT statistics.

Requirements: Write an application (C#, F#, JavaScript, or PowerShell) that outputs the following three data points:

- Which department has the largest number of employees who like Pineapple on their pizzas? 

- How many pizzas would you need to order to feed the Engineering department, assuming a pizza feeds 4 people? Ignore personal preferences.

- Which pizza topping combination is the most popular in each department and how many employees prefer it?

Please spend no more than 1 hour on this challenge. If you do not complete all three tasks in about an hour,
include a few sentences about your approach or things you would do differently, given more time.
